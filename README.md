# Project Details
The DevChallenge (https://devchallenge.com.br/challenges/5ed47992adee277fae224a0b/details) provided a webpage design that I needed to clone using HTML and CSS for the desktop. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and getting various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

# Skills Learned
Coming more comfortable with the CSS Flexbox model, especially justify-content and align-item rules
Continuing to practice Git and Github project management
Taking someone else's design and using HTML/CSS to make it happen
Working on a project over multiple days and focusing on certain sections only
